Super Scanner Software (S3)
=======================

Super Scanner Software (S3) is an open-source and **completely free software environment to implement a low-cost microscopy**, which uses Fourier Prychographic algorithm, **as a 3D scanner**.

Software Requirements
---------------------------------

> **Note:** currently, we are in the development phase and building the environment in machines that run the 64-bit version of **[Linux Mint 18 'Sarah'](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)** with MATE. As this GNU/Linux distribution **is based on another**, it is very probable that these packages work in your installation update to its latest version.

S3 is a set of Python modules to be executed in notebook Jupyter and Blender. For now, it is sufficient that you install:

- [**Anaconda3 (Python 3.5) 4.1.1**](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

- [**Blender 2.77a**](https://www.blender.org/download/). It does not require to be installed: download it, untar and execute it.

Importing and Executing the Code
------------------------------------------------
### In Blender
The files within **blend-scripts** can be imported in Blender from **Choose Screen layout**&rarr;**Scripting**&rarr;<kbd>Open</kbd>. To execute them, press <kbd>Run Script</kbd> button and wait for the result.
